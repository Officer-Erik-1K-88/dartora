# constants.dart

Defines common mathematical constants as `double` values:

- `e` – Euler’s number (base of natural logarithms).  Approximately `2.718281828459045`.
- `pi` – Ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter.  Approximately `3.141592653589793`.
- `phi` – The golden ratio `(1 + sqrt(5)) / 2`.  Approximately `1.618033988749895`.

These constants are used throughout the math modules.  They mirror the definitions in Dart’s `dart:math` but are provided here for convenience and to avoid importing the full math library.
