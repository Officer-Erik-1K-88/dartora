## Contents

### Collections

The collections module defines flexible iteration primitives and data structures for working with large or view‑based sequences.  Key classes include:

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [LargeIterable](collections/LargeIterable.md) | Presents values from a keyed map and optional extras as a lazy sequence with random access.  Supports windowing via `startIndex`/`indexTake` and transformation methods. |
| [LargeList](collections/LargeList.md) | A random‑access view over the union of a map’s values and an extra `IterationHolder` sequence.  Provides iteration, element lookup, filtering and mapping without copying data. |
| [IterableItems](collections/IterableItems.md) | Convenience subclass of `LargeIterable` for maps where the value type is already the desired type.  Iterates values in the order of a key list without applying a modifier. |
| [MultiViewList](collections/MultiViewList.md) | Wraps a list so that multiple views can be created cheaply.  Supports read/write access, iteration, and common list operations. |
| [OrderedMap](collections/OrderedMap.md) | A map that preserves insertion order.  Keys are stored in a `MultiViewList` and values in a normal map.  Provides predictable iteration order and standard map methods. |
| [Iteration](collections/Iteration.md) | An abstract mixin defining the contract for efficient, sliceable iteration.  Subclasses implement `sourceIterator`, `sourceLength` and `sourceGet` to support windowed views. |
| [IterationBase](collections/IterationBase.md) | A mutable list interface built upon `Iteration`.  Provides list operations (insert, remove, shuffle, sort, etc.) and view operations (`map`, `followedBy`, `expand`, `skip`, `take`).  Subclasses supply storage hooks. |
| [IterationHolder](collections/IterationHolder.md) | Concatenates multiple `IterationBase` sequences into a single list.  Handles removal, replacement and insertion across segment boundaries while keeping track of offsets. |
| [IterationItem](collections/IterationItem.md) | A read‑only `Iteration` wrapping any `Iterable` using `elementAt()` for retrieval.  Useful for converting arbitrary iterables into the `Iteration` framework. |
| [IterationList](collections/IterationList.md) | A concrete list implementation backed by a mutable Dart list.  Implements the hooks required by `IterationBase`. |
| [IteratorBuild](collections/IteratorBuild.md) | Builds a standard Dart iterator from an `elementAt` callback with start/end indices. |
| [IndexBaseIterator](collections/IndexBaseIterator.md) | Wraps any `Iterable` to provide an index‑based iterator using `elementAt`. |
| [HolderIterator](collections/HolderIterator.md) | Flattens a list of iterables (such as a matrix) into a single iterator.  Used by `Matrix` and `IterationHolder`. |
| [ImmutableIterationHolder](collections/ImmutableIterationHolder.md) | Presents several `Iteration` sequences as one read‑only concatenation.  Caches the total length and forwards element access across its children. |
| [IterationMap](collections/IterationMap.md) & [IterationItemMap](collections/IterationItemMap.md) | Ordered map view classes combining `Map` semantics with `Iteration` windowing.  `IterationMap` defines the abstract behaviour; `IterationItemMap` provides a concrete implementation backed by a `Map` and a list of keys. |

### Search

The search module implements a mini search engine with parsing, tagging and scoring.  Important classes include:

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Searchable](search/Searchable.md) | Base class for objects that can be searched.  Stores id, name, title, description, tags and the type (parent or child).  Provides a `children` holder and a factory for building a default implementation. |
| [ChildHolder](search/ChildHolder.md) | Holds children for a `Searchable`.  Manages keyed storage, typed key lists, and events for adding/removing items.  Provides iteration and common collection methods. |
| [Search](search/Search.md) | Executes a `SearchQuery` against a list of `Searchable` items.  Computes scores using `SearchQueryComparison` and orders results by descending score. |
| [SearchQuery](search/SearchQuery.md) | Compiled representation of a user query with optional, required and forbidden words and tags.  Provides scoring and validity checks. |
| [QueryEngine](search/QueryEngine.md) | Parses strings into `SearchQuery` objects using a set of `PatternItem`s that recognise quotes, negation, tags and wildcards. |
| [QueryBuilder](search/QueryBuilder.md) | A state machine used by the engine to accumulate words and tags into buckets. |
| [PatternItem](search/PatternItem.md) | Defines the behaviour of a single token in the query syntax.  Controls whether the token splits, escapes, defines tags or sets required/forbidden words. |
| [SearchItem](search/SearchItem.md) | Holds a matched `Searchable` and its `SearchQueryComparison`. |
| [PointedWord](search/PointedWord.md) | Pair of a word and the points associated with matching it.  Points are positive for desired words and negative for forbidden words. |
| [SearchQueryComparison](search/SearchQueryComparison.md) | Result of comparing a query against a text.  Holds positive/negative points, occurrence counts and flags for missing required or containing forbidden words. |
| [Tag](search/Tag.md) & [Tags](search/Tags.md) | A named value used for tag search; `Tags` is a map of tag names to `Tag` values. |
| [SearchableType](search/SearchableType.md) | Enum for parent/child `Searchable` roles. |
| [ChildActionType](search/ChildActionType.md) | Enum describing events fired by `ChildHolder`. |
| [QueryType](search/QueryType.md) | Enum indicating whether a query word is optional, required, forbidden, or a combination. |

### Math (basic)

Math basics provide helper functions and constants for numeric operations and rounding:

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [comparison](math/basic/comparison.md) | Defines `numberCast<T>()` to coerce numbers from dynamic values and wrappers around `min` and `max` for numeric types. |
| [log](math/basic/log.md) | Implements `exp`, natural and base‑10 logarithms (`ln`, `log`, `log2`, `logB`) using ratio and natural logs. |
| [root](math/basic/root.md) | Provides `pow`, `sqrt` and `nthRoot` functions with edge‑case handling. |
| [rounding](math/basic/rounding.md) | Contains the `RoundMode` class for configurable rounding policies and a `round()` function that rounds doubles to a fixed number of decimals using a given mode. |
| [constants](math/basic/constants.md) | Defines mathematical constants `e`, `pi`, and `phi` as doubles. |

### Math (advanced)

Advanced math includes structures and algorithms beyond basic arithmetic:

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [BaseRadix](math/advanced/BaseRadix.md) | Represents a number in an arbitrary radix with its code (string) and numeric value.  Provides conversion to/from different bases and arithmetic operations that return new `BaseRadix` instances. |
| [Curves](math/advanced/Curves.md) | Functions for growth and smoothing.  `stepwiseGrowth()` returns an integer step with adjustable speed/length/factor parameters; `sigmoidCurve()` maps input through a logistic‑like curve with configurable center and baseline. |
| [Matrix](math/advanced/Matrix.md) | A 2‑D numeric array with matrix operations: addition, subtraction, scalar and matrix multiplication, power, division, determinant, adjoint, cofactor, inverse, transpose, identity and (experimental) row echelon form.  Implements `Iteration` to traverse elements in row‑major order. |
| [Points](math/advanced/Points.md) | Classes for representing positive/negative point tallies and their stepwise modifiers.  `Points` is an abstract base with arithmetic; `UnmodifiablePoints` and `ModifiablePoints` provide concrete implementations for immutable and mutable points. |

### Util

Utility classes provide error handling and modification tracking:

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [ModificationListener](util/ModificationListener.md) | Tracks nested modification scopes and counts the number of modification steps.  Supports start/step/end/reset operations and reports the level of modification. |
| [ModificationAction](util/ModificationAction.md) & [_ModCatch](util/ModCatch.md) | Records a modification at a specific level; internal helper used by the listener. |
| [ModLevel](util/ModLevel.md) & [ModResetType](util/ModResetType.md) | Enums for modification severity and reset types. |
| [BaseException](util/BaseException.md), [TypeException](util/TypeException.md), [KeyException](util/KeyException.md) | Structured error classes with descriptive messages for generic errors, type mismatches and invalid keys. |
